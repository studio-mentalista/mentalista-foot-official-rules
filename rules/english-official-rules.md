## Mentalista foot, official rules

##### 1 - Ball

The ball must be motorized and be able to move back and forth, left and right and diagonally. Its size can vary which will influence the size of the field. The original ball measures 7 cm in diameter and weighs 145 g. It can be larger as long as its diameter does not exceed 22 cm. The ball can be controlled by wifi or bluetooth as long as no other action than the brain action is sent to the ball during the game.

Any new mechanical system or protocol of connection with the ball must be approved by Mentalista to be considered valid.

##### 2 - Playing field

The field follows proportion rules based on the size of the ball. The field must measure the diameter of the ball multiplied by 50 for the length and by 35 for the width. For a ball with a diameter of 7 cm, the field must measure 350 cm (7x50) in length and 245 cm (7x35) in width.

The field must be marked on the ground and visible to players and spectators.

The size of the field must be checked by the referee before the match. Once validated, the data must be recorded in a book or digitally.

If the ball goes out of bounds, it will be put back in the center with no advantage or disadvantage to any team.

##### 3 - Players

The number of players is variable as long as it is equal in both teams. A Mentalista Foot team starts with one person. The minimum number of players for a match is two.

The player must have at least one brain. Random tests can be performed by the referee if he doubts the humanity of a player. If one of the players turns out not to be a living being, the victory can be questioned. The presence of a goalkeeper is not mandatory in Mentalista Foot.

Finally, the age, sex and physical condition of the players is not a constraint to play as long as each player is aware of his actions.

##### 4 - Equipment

Basic player equipment includes a team jersey and a headband. Teams are free to wear shorts, socks and shoes as long as the whole team has the same equipment color. If there is a goalkeeper, he must wear an outfit with colors that distinguish him from other players and referees. He may wear gloves. Players are free to wear lucky charms as long as they preserve the safety of the players. Players must have an identical electroencephalographic headset to play. In official competitions, players are connected to the same electronic board to have the same latency. The referees check the equipment before the start of the match.

##### 5 - Referees: main and algorithmic

The human referee has the ability to start the game, to call the fouls, and to end the game after the time limit or request of the losing player. He is assisted by an algorithm that detects doped brains. The human referee has a whistle. The algorithm is silent.

The referee must be sworn in by Mentalista. Any match conducted by a non-certified referee will result in sanctions.

##### 6 - Algorithmic level

In official matches, the algorithmic level is 8 out of 10. In unofficial games it can be reduced to level 6. It is rare that it is lower than 6, as it is rare that the algorithm exceeds level 8.

##### 7 - Duration of the match

The duration of a match is random. It is adapted to the mental capacity of the players. As Mentalista Foot requires a lot of training, the player who loses the game when the points are counted is free to stop the game at any time. The player who wins the point cannot stop the match.

The duration of an official match is 25 minutes.

##### 8 - face-off

The face-off takes place by placing the ball in the center and pointing the ball to the left.

##### 9 - Goal scored

The only way to score is to bring the whole ball into the cage. During certain matches, the referee may call on video assistance.

##### 10 - Fouls and unsportsmanlike behavior

Any physical touch between players of the opposite team is forbidden. It can be subject to a disconnection of 5 to 20 seconds, depending on the intention of the offender. Cognitive doping is strictly prohibited and will be recognized by the algorithm.

Some serious fouls can handicap the player. The algorithm after a mistake can decide to increase the difficulty level for the offending player.
